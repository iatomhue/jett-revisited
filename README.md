This is an updated version of the jett library to work on java 11 and POIv5.2.2  

To run all the tests and class compiled get a jar.  
In this release :  
Updated the underlying library of apache-poi to 5.2.2

Updated the code to work with the API changes in poi 5.2.2  
97% of Unit tests pass.  
  There are about 6 that fail due to defaults such as treatments of space and certain formula that have changes with the new excel format in 5.2.2
